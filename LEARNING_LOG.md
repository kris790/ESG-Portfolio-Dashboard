# Learning Log: ESG Portfolio Dashboard

## New Skills Acquired:
- ✅ Financial data modeling (portfolio calculations)
- ✅ Weighted average algorithms
- ✅ Context-aware AI prompting
- ✅ PDF generation from React components
- ✅ Click-through interactivity (chart → table)
- ✅ Service layer architecture

## Challenges Overcome:
1. **ESG score aggregation**: Learned to handle missing data gracefully
2. **AI context building**: Structured portfolio data for AI comprehension
3. **Chart interactivity**: Implemented bidirectional component communication
4. **PDF export**: Converted DOM elements to PDF with proper formatting

## Code Patterns to Reuse:
- Service layer with retry logic
- Custom React hooks for state management
- TypeScript interfaces for financial data
- Caching strategy for API responses

## Time Investment:
- Setup & planning: 4 hours
- Core features: 20 hours
- AI integration: 6 hours
- UI/UX polish: 8 hours
- **Total: ~38 hours**

## If I Built This Again:
- Start with TypeScript interfaces first
- Mock data earlier for faster iteration
- Add tests for calculation functions
- Use React Query for data fetching
